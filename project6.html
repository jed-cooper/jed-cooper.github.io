            <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
            <p class="project-text">

                This data project was designed to examine if the introduction of streaming services in 2004 led to a decline in physical album sales.<br><br>

                <u>Key Insights</u>:<br>
                1. The widespread implementation of streaming services (the period 2004-2005) led to a sharp decline in the sales of physical albums.<br>
                2. The year preceeding this decline (the period 2003-2004) indicates there was a recovery in the number of CD purchases made.<br>
                3. From 2007 onwards there is a steady increase in the sales of LPs/EPs pressed to vinyl, with sales continuing to grow up to 2019.<br>

            <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
            <p class="project-text">

                <u>Filtering:</u><br>
                In order to simplify the data and make sense of overall trends, it was necessary to drop columns of data from the original dataframe. I endevour as a software developer
                to write succinct code, and I had intended to use the df.drop() function to remove all unnecessary columns using one line of code. For whatever reason
                (I believe because of operator syntax) I could not get this function to operate on the dataset.<br><br>
                
                I did find a work-around using the df.pop() function, which is a simple procedure but meant putting the dataframe through the same
                function multiple times (once for each column removed), which increased the time of development and perhaps the processing power needed to clean the data.<br><br>
                
                <u>Indexing:</u><br>
                Prior to exporting the dataset before the visualisation stage, I needed to filter data by year to fit the parameters of the hypothesis (1994-2019). Up until this point,
                the column denoting ‘Year’ and its data had not been operable as for some reason the program didn’t recognise the column ‘Year’, even though when I listed the columns
                it was clearly displayed in the console. <br><br>
                
                I began troubleshooting by delimiting residual whitespace that may have been present, I tried reassigning the name of the column, and when that didn’t work I tried
                exporting the file to excel, cleaning the data in the spreadsheet and re-exporting the file. This only worked the first time; when I tried it with the other dataframes,
                it never worked again. Anyway after a couple of days of stressing about it, the program (for some esoteric reason..) began to recognise the column. Hooray!<br><br>
                
                <u>X/Y-axis labelling</u><br>
                
                Using matplotlib to test out different visualisations was definitely my favourite part of the project, as it allowed me to finally see the hard-earned fruits of my data-scrubbing.
                I originally intended to use the ‘Year’ column as the index for each dataframe, but there were prior issues and upon creating the line graph the labels on the
                x-axis became skewed and overlapped, so I had to become familiar with the the plt.xtick() function of matplotlib. <br><br>
                
                To get the data displayed properly and fit the final graphic, I chose to pass an array of string values for each year to the xtick function, which placed the strings at
                consistent intervals along the x-axis, and worked quite nicely: plt.xticks(range(len(years)), years, size='small').<br><br>
            </p>
            <p></p>

            <h3>TECHNIQUES</h3>
            <p class="project-text">

                - libraries used include pandas, matplotlib and numpy.
                - remove missing values (df.dropna(subset=['value'], inplace=True))<br>
                - filter column based on condition (df2 = df[(df['Metric']=='value') & (df['year'] >= 1994)])<br>
                - filter rows based on string (df_drop = df[(df['Format'].str.contains('CD|LP/EP|Cassette') == True)])<br>
                - summarise values & round to 1 decimal place (df2 = df[['year', 'value']].set_index('year').groupby('year').sum())<br><br>
    
            </p>
            <p></p>

            <h3>EXTENSIONS</h3>
            <p class="project-text">The project could be extended to include futher analyses of: <br>
                - the recovery of CD sales over the period 2003-2004 <br>
                - the resurgence in vinyl sales beginning 2007<br>
                - the short-/long-term effects that streaming services had on musicians, independent record labels and large-scale media outlets.<br><br>
            </p>
            <P></P>
