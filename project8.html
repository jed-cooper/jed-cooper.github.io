            <h3>GEOTECHNICAL REPORT</h3>
            <p class='project-text'>
                <i>Introduction</i><br>
                The scope of this project was the analysis and evaluation of borehole data from a geotechnical investigation into a proposed offshore windfarm site.<br><br>

                Ground work was undertaken by Fugro Seacore Limited (FSCL) under the supervision of DONG Energy Power (UK) Ltd at the West of Duddon Sands Offshore Wind Farm site, located in the Irish Sea.<br><br>
                
                The purpose of the investigation was to provide sufficient data on the ground conditions and enable the detailed design of foundations for one-hundred and thirty-nine wind turbines and two substations. 
                The foundations may be Mono piles or Suction Bucket Foundations (SBF) for the wind turbines, whereas the use of jacket pile structures for the sub-stations is anticipated.<br><br>
        
                <i>Methodology</i><br>
                The acquired dataset contained logs for thirty cable percussion boreholes in total, drilled to a maximum depth of 68.40m. It also included data for in-situ and laboratory tests recording 
                soil properties found at various depths, such as soil type, moisture content, plasticity index, undrained shear strength, relative density and rock core quality designation.<br><br>

                Acquiring extensive data of the boring processes and the results of sample testing was fundamental to a further analysis 
                of the geotechnial properties beneath the seabed (subsurface characterisation, soil and rock strength, particle density, compressibility, etc).<br><br>
                
                The methods used to extract borehole samples included:<br>
                - standard penetration tests (SPT)<br>
                - cone penetration tests (CPT)<br> 
                - rock core sampling<br>
                - hammer sampling<br>
                - push sampling <br>
                - bulk sampling<br>
                - bailer sampling<br><br>

                <i>Analysis and Interpretation</i><br>
                The geotechnical analysis shows a range of soil conditions that affect the structural viability of foundation types at each borehole location. 
                Geological findings highlight formations of silt, clay, and sand layers, with denser material present between depths of 10-25 m at key boreholes. 
                These formations influence the foundational stability based on varying shear strength, bearing capacity, and moisture content observed across the soil profiles.<br><br>

                Soil tests indicate moisture content varying between 15-30%, with denser layers showing bulk densities around 1800-2200 kg/m³, suggesting favorable compaction and stability properties at certain depths. 
                Shear strengths observed above 80 kPa at depths exceeding 15 m at boreholes M02 and nD06 indicate higher load-bearing potential, ideal for wind turbine monopiles and Suction Bucket Foundations (SBF). 
                Conversely, boreholes with low shear strength, high plasticity, or moisture at shallower depths pose challenges for stability without further soil stabilization.

                The soil’s porosity (35-50%), liquid limit (25-40%), and unconfined compressive strength (0.5-1.5 MPa) suggest adequate compaction but recommend caution in areas with weaker structural integrity. 
                For boreholes below specifications, soil improvement techniques like pre-loading or grouting are advised to increase soil strength and density, which will ensure a stable foundation platform for wind turbine and substation installations.<br><br>

                
                <i>Conclusions and Recommendations</i><br>
                To conclude, the borehole sites M02, nD06, nE08, and nE09A meet the specifications for further development, making them principle locations for extended geotechnical and environmental testing.<br><br>

                <u>Recommendations for further evaluation of the proposed construction sites</u>:<br>
                1. Additional ground investigations, such as cone penetration tests (CPT) or additional borehole drilling in the surrounding area (20-50m radius), to confirm soil homogeniety and identify potential anomalies.<br>
                2. Detailed geotechnical testing and assessment of: compressibility and settlement (consolidation coefficient, modulus of elasticity, poisson's ratio), hydraulic conductivity, seismic risk / liquifaction potential (shear wave velocity, damping ratio) and corrosion potential of the soil.<br>
                3. Environmental impact assessment, including an analysis of marine habitats, water quality and navigational safety.<br>
                4. Implementation of a monitoring / quality assurance plan during construction, ensuring that foundation work adheres to the design specifications and soil performance expectations.<br>
                5. Development of a contingency plan for unexpected ground conditions that may arise during construction, including procedures for adjusting foundation design or addressing unforeseen soil behavior.<br><br>

                Other approaches to improve the structural integrity of soil layers at locations falling below specification include drilling deeper foundations to reach more stable soil layers, and the use of alternative foundation types (such as floating, mat or piled raft foundations).<br><br>

                If improvement methods are not feasible, assess nearby locations for better soil characteristics. This will reduce risk and ensure a more cost-effective construction.<br><br>

            <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
            <p class="project-text">

                <u>reverse-engineering the AGS format</u>:<br>
                - the AGS file was developed to standardise geotechnical data and to make transferring data between engineers much easier.<br>
                - the file is generally usable with only a handful of open-source software, most of which I found difficult to impossble to work with.<br>
                - to mitigate the challenge and prepare the data for visualisation, I built a custom AGS-parser using Python which processes the AGS document in blocks and produces CSV/Excel files.<br><br>

                <u>no compressibility data available</u>:<br>
                - the acquired data didn't contain key test data needed for compressibility assessments, such as modulus of elasticity, coefficient of volume, pre-consolidation / over-consolidation ratios, etc.<br>
                - I've included an estimate for the bearing capacity of the soil at various depths using Skempton's Formula, as a placeholder for compressibility before more tests can be done.<br><br>

            <p class="project-text">
                The project could be extended to include:<br>
                - a software release for the AGS parser.<br>
                - estimates for compressibility, hydraulic conductivity and permeability.<br>
                - data from seismic tests.<br><br>
